                    <p id="aboutText">Donald Schermerhorn is known for his innovative approach marshalling traditional and contemporary design concepts in each design project.</p>
                    <p id="aboutText">It is a style complemented by a discriminating sense of proportion and scale, discreet but innovative use of color, and a deft hand with detail.</p>
                    <p id="aboutText">Twenty-five years with his eponymous firm has brought his aesthetic and practical skills to residential and commercial projects from California to Lyford Cay, Boston to Palm Beach. These clients note his accessibility and problem-solving project management returning to him again and again with additional homes, offices, shops and building lobbies.</p>
                    <p id="aboutText">Donald's sophisticated, highly edited, and unpretentious rooms have been featured in several prominent showhouses such as Kips Bay, Hamptons and Holiday House, design magazines, and the New York Times where Penelope Green called him “a modest man with a painterly eye.”</p>
